## <a id="features-aa"></a>**Features**

When you go to [Coders Parkhouse](https://coders-parkhouse-e4a324d9bf40.herokuapp.com/), this is what is waiting for you.

### **Welcome to Coders Parkhouse**

At the entrance/exit you are being greeted and two options are being given to you:
  1. To park the car.
  2. To leave the parking lot.
  - ![Entrance/Exit](/assets/images/features/feature1-welcome.png)

### **Park the car**

- If you choose to park the car, the rules of the parking house are being displayed to you. You are also being asked if you accept to the terms of use, which you can accept or reject and search for a better place to park.
- ![Rules](/assets/images/features/feature2-rules.png)

- If you reject the terms of use, you will be greeted nicely.
- ![Rules No](/assets/images/features/feature3-rules-no.png)

- If you accept and you do want to park here, you will be taken to the next step.
- ![Rules Yes](/assets/images/features/feature4-rules-yes-regplate-entry.png)

### **Entering Registration Number**

- Here you must enter your registration number but according to one of the four given patterns. Instructions are telling you to use letters, digits and dashes only, other characters will trigger Invalid Input.

- In case you use valid pattern for your registration number, you can have 2 scenarios:
  1. You type in valid registration number and you can go further to enter the parking duration.
  - ![Regplates Valid Not Existing](/assets/images/features/feature5-regplates-valid-not-existing-hours.png)


  2. You type in valid registration number, but you find out there is a debt from the last time, which you need to take care of, so that you can park here again. Behind the scenes the code is checking if the given registration is already inside the google sheet. In this case it is which represents your "debt".
  - ![Regplates Valid Existing](/assets/images/features/feature8-regplate-existing.png)

### **Paying Debt/Actually Mistake**

- You have 2 options here to pay your debt, to be able to park again or to type in your registration number again because actually it was a typo.

  1. If you choose to pay your debt, after the transaction is over, you will be able to enter your registration number again and park as you wish. In reality the reg. number is getting deleted from the google sheet, so you are able to enter with the same registration again.
  - ![Regplates Valid Existing Paying](/assets/images/features/feature10-regplates-existing-pay.png)

  2. If you actually made a mistake and you choose "new". You will be taken back to enter your registration number again.
  - ![Regplates Valid Existing New](/assets/images/features/feature9-regplate-existing-no.png)

### **Parking Duration(Hours)**

- ![Regplates Valid Hours](/assets/images/features/feature5-regplates-valid-not-existing-hours.png)
- When we manage to pay off our dept (^.-) and we enter the valid reg. number, we need to enter number of hours or let's say duration of our parking. In this case the number is unlimited.
- ![Hours Info](/assets/images/features/feature6-hours-info.png)

- In the background there is a list in program which holds the registration number, number of hours and price which is calculated according to the hours we enter.
- Price is calculated as: Hours * 3euro
- At this moment the list is being inserted into the google sheet.
- In this step the info about our parking is being presented to us.

### **Return/NotYet**

- After we are presented with the info in the end, we have two options:

  1. To leave, in this case we are typing in "not yet".
  - ![Not Yet](/assets/images/features/feature11-not-yet.png)

  2. Second option is to type in "return", to get back to the parking lot to pick up our car. It brings us to the beginning of our application.
  - ![Return](/assets/images/features/feature12-return.png)

### **Leave Parking Lot**

- After we come back to pick up our car, either by entering "return" at the end of our parking process or by restarting the program and we choose the option number two, to leave the parking lot, we need to enter our registrations again.
- By entering our reg. number again, the system is checking if the reg. number is in the google sheet(did we park here at all).

- ![Leaveing Parking Lot](/assets/images/features/feature13-regplatesleave.png)

- Here we are going to have 2 options.
- First one where the registration number is valid but car is not parked at our parking lot(not present in the google sheet).
- Second option, where registration number is valid and is parked at our parking lot(is present in the google sheet).

  - **Registration Not Existing**
  - ![Registration Not Existing](/assets/images/features/feature20-valid-regplateleave-not-existing.png)
  - Here we have 2 scenarios again, where the driver will be able to type in again the reg. number in case he made a typo or he can freely walk away in case he missed the parking lot(^_^).

    - Re-enter the registration number
      - I you type in "yes".
      - ![Re-enter Reg Number](/assets/images/features/feature22-regplates-not-existing-yes.png)

    - Walk away
      - If you type in "no".
      - ![Walk Away](/assets/images/features/feature21-regplates-not-existing-no.png)
  
  - **Registration Existing**
    - This will lead to details being loaded(we are loading info from the google sheet).
    - ![Registration Existing](/assets/images/features/feature24.png)


### **Parking Details**

- ![Details Loading](/assets/images/features/feature14-details-loading.png)

- When we enter registration number which is present in our system, we are getting full initial details about our parking.
- In the background the system is reading from the google sheet and pulling the row according to the registration number.
- After that we can choose between three possible scenarios, which represent our time of arrival.

### **Time of Arrival**

- According to the option we choose here, our price will be calculated. Meaning if we choose Earlier or On Point the price will actually be the same as the initial one, while if we choose Later, a fee of 10â‚¬ will be added to the initial price(the price here is calculated accodring to our parking rules).

- **Earlier/On Point**
  
- ![Earlier/On Point](/assets/images/features/feature15-1.png)

- **Later**

- ![Later](/assets/images/features/feature16-3.png)

### **Discount Code**

- Suddenly the driver will be asked if he knows about the CI discount code, to get 10% off of the final price.

- Here we will have two scenarios, where driver will know the code or he wouldn't. The Driver will be answered in a funny manner, according to the scenario.

  - **With Code**
  - ![With Code](/assets/images/features/feature23.png)

  - **No Code**
  - ![No Code](/assets/images/features/feature17-no-code.png)

### **Pay at Exit**

- In the end, we are prompted to pay the final price we got.
- There will be 2 scenarios again, where we can choose between "pay" or anything else.
- In order to exit the parking lot, we must choose "pay" in the end.

  - **Not Wanting to Pay**
  - ![Not Paying](/assets/images/features/feature19-leave-no-pay.png)

  - **Pay**
  - ![Paying](/assets/images/features/feature18-leave-paying.png)

  - After we pay, we are greeted again and we can freely exit the parking lot.
  - In this step program is deleting the info from our google sheet.
